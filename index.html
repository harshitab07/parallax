        <h2>Blissfull Nature</h2>
        <p>Think about the music of the birds, the sound of the leaves, the smell of the flower, the tunes of the flowing rivers. It makes my mind feel that I am in Heaven.
            The rain, the summer, the spring, and the autumn all are from our Nature god.
            We should be thankful to nature for showing and giving us all these heavenly thing.
            Even the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land where we stand all are from nature.
            Nature is also a medicine for all of the living beings on this earth, the herbs, shrubs, vegetables, fruits, and many more are the medicines from nature.
            They are mentally helpful for us by relieving the stress. If you go to any  mountains or any natural place you can hear nature's music, you will find your  inner peace and you will not sense your stress anymore. Meditation with nature makes us mentally and physically strong. If you cannott find your peace where you are living, go to villages, lakes, etc. They will give you peace. For me, that natural place is my grandma's house. When we walk up, we can hear the song of the birds, the fresh air. There are not many electrical appliances like a stove, fan, and TV. Because that is a village. But nowadays all the trees are been cut. The air is polluted because of more industries and vehicle activities. The land is polluted by throwing plastics and the water is polluted by throwing plastic waste and oil. This will lead to almost extinction of nature. Then we will not be able to get fresh air and water. So we should help nature by planting trees and stop throwing plastics and waste on nature.</p>

        <h2>Beholding Beauty</h2>
        <p>While people created art and built cities and argued about golden ratios, the natural world continued existing. In Western colonial cultures, a renewed appreciation for the beauty of the natural world grew steadily throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries—I imagine this as wealthy white society looking out at rugged or serene landscapes and saying things like hmm and aah and yonder.
            But why does there seem to be a universal appeal when it comes to certain types of landscape, and how do you know that sunsets are beautiful?  
            For some, natural beauty means the absence of perfection or repetition, but for others it is the widespread, symmetrical repetition that is so pleasing, so meaningful, so memorable—both havoc and order are spread richly throughout the natural world. Over ten years ago a psychology professor working in Tokyo, Shigeru Watanabe, found that Java sparrows could distinguish between harmonious and discordant music, preferring the more tuneful tunes, and perhaps that is all human appreciation is too.
            Do we always prefer the harmonious to the discordant, whatever that distinction might look like to us?
            It is not my place to say that the music you're listening to sounds terrible. On that note, harmony is very much its own kind of beautiful, and it looks and feels like different things to all of us. For me, harmony is found in the way tree branches will sometimes grow curving around to hold each other, the way rain disappears into the surface of the sea, the sitting and sighing in front of landscapes that are too large to comprehend, and when we have enough energy left to dance at the end of the day.</p>
